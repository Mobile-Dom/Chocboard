# Chocboard
Chocboard is a custom keyboard PCB using kail choc pg1350 switches in the ISO layout.

I've been wanting a keyboard using Kailh Choc switches for a while and there arent that many PCBs for them, and the ones that are there are ortholinear or split board etc. i just want a simple 105 key ( potentially a TKL option later) board in UK ISO layout that just happens to use Choc PG1350 switches.
